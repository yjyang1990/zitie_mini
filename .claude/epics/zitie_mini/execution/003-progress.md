  "t-grid": "grid/grid",
  "t-popup": "popup/popup",
  "t-sticky": "sticky/sticky",
  // ... 15+ TDesign components utilized
}
```

### Template Selection Logic
```javascript
// Template usage tracking
recordTemplateUsage(templateId) {
  const history = getStorageSync('template_usage_history', []);
  // Track usage with timestamp for recommendations
}

// Seamless page integration
onUseTemplate(template) {
  app.globalData.selectedTemplate = template;
  wx.switchTab({ url: '/pages/index/index' });
}
```
